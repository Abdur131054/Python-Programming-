    "Unlike many other programming languages, Python does not use two common symbols to define a block of code:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead, Python is designed to be more readable, almost like English. When writing an if statement, you simply \n",
    "place a colon : at the end of the condition. After pressing Enter, the cursor automatically moves one tab forward, \n",

    "Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is applied automatically, but if it is missed, you can press the Tab key once to add it manually. \n",
    "After the if statement, you may write as many lines of code as needed within the block.\n",
    "To write an else statement, simply press Backspace to return to the same level of indentation as the if, and continue writing your code."
